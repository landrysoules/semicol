# semicol package

semicol is a simple port of an eclipse functionality I was missing in atom : type a semicolon anywhere on your line and this package will place it correctly at the end of the line for you.
For the cases when you want your semicolon to stay where you typed it, just type 2 semicolons at the place you want it!
